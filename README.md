# Analysis-of-Housing-Market
This project involves statistical analysis of King's County housing market data using R. An interactive dashboard has been created using R Shiny. The dashboard can be accessed @ https://sreekanth29.shinyapps.io/kings_county_analysis/

The project primarily involves the study of the King County housing market from the King County housing dataset. The objective is to determine the relationship between the house price in King County and the house features through statistical inference. This project was a part of the 'Linear Regression and Design' coursework and hence the focus has been on inference rather than prediction.
